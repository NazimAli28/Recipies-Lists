                                    Whizz the chocolate into small pieces
                                    in a food processor. In the largest mixing bowl you have, tip in the flour, sugar,
                                    cocoa, oil, 100ml soured cream, eggs,
                                    vanilla and 100ml water. Whisk everything together with electric beaters until
                                    smooth, then quickly stir in 100g of the
                                    whizzed-up chocolate bits. Divide between the 10 cases, then bake for 20 mins until
                                    a skewer inserted comes out clean
                                    (make sure you don't poke it into a chocolate chip bit). Cool on a wire rack.</dd>

                                    stirring, until the chocolate is melted and you have a smooth icing. Chill in the

                                    top of the muffins, then tuck in.</dd>
