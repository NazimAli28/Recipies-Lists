                                    until light and fluffy, then beat in the
                                    eggs one at a time. Sift over the flour and cocoa powder and beat into the butter
                                    mix, then fold through the chocolate
                                    chips. The mix can be made up to 2 days ahead and chilled or frozen for a month, or
                                    used straight away.</dd>

                                <dd>To bake, heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. If the mix is at room temperature, place
                                    evenly spaced spoonfuls on
                                    parchment-lined baking sheets, allowing 2 tbsp for each cookie. If the mix is fridge
                                    cold, you can roll it into 40g
                                    balls before baking. The balls can be frozen and the biscuits baked from frozen, but
                                    they'll need a few minutes more.
                                    Bake for 12-15 mins until spread out and crusty around the outside. Leave to cool
                                    slightly and enjoy warm, or leave to
                                    cool completely and eat cold. The biscuits will keep in a tin for three days.</dd>

                                <dd>As an optional extra, the biscuits can be dipped in chocolate. To do this, melt your
                                    chosen type of chocolate in a bowl
                                    over a pan of simmering water or in the microwave. Leave to cool a little, then dip
                                    half of each biscuit in the
                                    chocolate and leave them on parchment-lined trays somewhere cool to set. Again, the
                                    dipped biscuits will keep for up to
                                    three days in a tin or lidded plastic container.</dd>
